## Menu Items

In order to add a new item to the main menu you need to create a Markdown file.

* The file name should have only lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens and end in `.md`
* The file should start with a [Front Matter](#front-matter).
* The file should contain only valid markdown, see [content info](#front-matter).
