The government of Bolivia will implement the Development Gateway Foundation’s Aid Management Platform (AMP) as part of a national strategy to better manage international assistance.

AMP is a Web-based software solution for developing country governments and donors. The platform, based on open source software, provides a virtual workspace for government employees managing aid resources.

The Development Gateway Foundation, in conjunction with the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, has already conducted a technical assessment of the Bolivian government’s systems and processes for managing official development assistance. During the assessment, the foundation staff worked with government officials to identify key needs and gaps in the aid management system and to outline the next steps in AMP implementation. The software is designed to improve and streamline processes for planning, monitoring, coordinating, tracking and reporting on international aid flows and activities.

“Bolivia selected AMP to improve the government’s capacity to review, track and monitor all aid flows and programs,” said Marco Scuriatti of the World Bank. “This software solution will create much-needed transparency for government officials, and will enable them to better analyze and report on their situation. These steps are critical to improve donor harmonization, coordination and results from development aid.”

Official development assistance in Bolivia accounts for more than nine percent of GDP.

The Development Gateway Foundation is now developing the prototype Aid Management Platform based on the country-specific needs identified, with an initial release scheduled for early 2007. Once implemented, the platform will provide the Bolivian government with the capacity to review proposed development projects for alignment with national development plans, create a portfolio management system to track financial and operational progress, integrate ministry and donor activities, and evaluate impact.
