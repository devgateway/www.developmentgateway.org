After the devastating earthquake, Development Gateway sends condolences and well-wishes to our colleagues and friends in the Government of Nepal, the donor community, civil society organizations, and to the millions of people affected by this terrible disaster.

As emergency response efforts continue, DG stands in support of our government and civil society colleagues as they ensure that generous donations coming from all over the world are properly tracked and directed by national authorities. In the long term, we’ll work with our friends to contribute however possible to the reconstruction effort.

In the meantime, individual staff members are donating to [GlobalGiving](http://www.globalgiving.org/projects/nepal-earthquake-relief-fund/)’s dedicated earthquake relief fund. As a neighbor and close partner, GlobalGiving has a strong history of ensuring aid goes to those who need it most. As part of the [OpenGovHub](http://opengovhub.org/) community, we are also contributing to [AccountabilityLab](http://www.accountabilitylab.org/), a Hub member and founder of the Nepal OpenGov Hub, to help establish mobile citizen helpdesks to gather information and provide immediate support.

We would encourage others interested in donating to provide cash donations to humanitarian organizations, which is proven to be the most effective approach to assisting relief efforts. A complete list of all humanitarian organizations accepting cash donations for disaster responses can be found at [InterAction.org](http://www.interaction.org/).
