The Development Gateway Foundation announced today an agreement to collaborate with the French Development Agency (AFD) to publish its tenders online.

The aid agency chose dgMarket, the foundation’s platform for online tenders, to publish tenders for all projects funded by AFD. It will include notices from 60 countries in three languages: French, Spanish, and English. In 2005, the French agency committed approximately $3.4 billion, primarily to countries in Africa and Asia.

“We have numerous complex aid programs running simultaneously in priority countries,” explained Jean-Michel Severino, CEO of AFD. “dgMarket was the most cost-effective way for us to help our beneficiaries manage these tenders. It will also serve as a tracking tool for all our projects and contribute to the policy of transparency at AFD.”

“We welcome this opportunity to partner with the French aid agency,” said Mark Fleeton, CEO of the foundation. “The dgMarket platform reduces procurement costs by providing a global marketplace to advertise tenders. The AFD Web site will extend the reach and coverage of dgMarket.”
