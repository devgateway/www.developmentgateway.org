Mr. Francis. S. Dogo has been promoted to the position of Senior Director, Country Operations, of the Development Gateway Foundation. This is a new position created to reflect the Development Gateway’s focus on delivering Internet solutions in developing countries for effective aid coordination and government procurement, as well as other areas of high impact.

As Director, Country Operations, Mr. Dogo will lead the foundation’s efforts to promote the use of tools such as the Aid Management Platform, a web-based system that helps developing country governments and their donors manage international aid more efficiently, and dgMarket, an online government tender information system that is already saving billions of dollars for developing country governments. Promotion and implementation of these tools in different countries will leverage the Development Gateway’s network of local Country Gateway partners, in addition to direct work with the respective national governments.

Mr. Dogo joined the Development Gateway in 2001. Prior to this promotion, he was Manager of the foundation’s Country Gateways Program, which has helped establish 50 locally owned social enterprise partnerships to provide web-related services supporting local development. Prior to the Development Gateway he spent several years as a financial analyst at Bloomberg Financial Markets, and has additional experience in international business and private sector development.

"Mr. Dogo brings the right combination of experience and skills to this position, including a strong background in business and finance, a good understanding of technology issues and how they apply to developing countries, plus direct experience in the field of international development. He is a great asset to this organization," said Mark Fleeton, Chief Executive Officer.
