[Accessible Information on Development Activities](http://www.aiddata.org/ "AidData") ([AiDA](http://www.aiddata.org/ "AidData")), the largest online directory of information about international development activities, has broadened its database for the first time to include projects funded by a non-traditional donor organization.

More than 3,800 listings from the publicly available database of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are now aggregated on AiDA, a project of the non-profit Development Gateway Foundation. AiDA supports the global aid effectiveness agenda by increasing transparency and enabling better coordination among donors and governments. The database now contains information on more than 500,000 development activities gathered from publicly-available data from a wide range of bilateral and multilateral donors.

Private philanthropic foundations account for an increasingly large share of total funding for development worldwide. Since its creation in 2000, the Gates Foundation has grown into the largest charitable foundation in the world with a major initiative to support global development. Disseminating information about privately-funded projects significantly enhances the value of AiDA as a one-stop source for information on development activities.
AiDA provides a starting place for anyone needing a quick overview of who is doing what in international development, where they are doing it, and with what funds. It provides the user with project-level information on funding and implementing agency, and can be filtered by country, donor, and topic.
