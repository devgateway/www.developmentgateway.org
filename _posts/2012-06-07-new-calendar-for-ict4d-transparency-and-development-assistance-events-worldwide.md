There is a new [Event Calendar](/news/eventscalendar) on the Development Gateway website with conferences and forums taking place around the world. The calendar includes events that are focused on issues such as transparency, governance, aid effectiveness, and ICT4D—the topics and themes that constitute the bulk of Development Gateway’s work. We hope that site visitors will be able to use this calendar to find out about important discussions that are taking place worldwide.

The calendar will be updated regularly, but we could use your help. Please feel free to share information on relevant events whether you are personally involved in them or not.
