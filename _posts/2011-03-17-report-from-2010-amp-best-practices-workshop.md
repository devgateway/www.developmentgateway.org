In December 2010, Development Gateway hosted the third annual AMP Best Practices Workshop in Nairobi, Kenya. The workshop brings together delegates from governments that have implemented or are interested in implementing the [Aid Management Program](/programs/aid-management-program/aid-management-platform "Aid Management Program") to discuss their experiences and lessons learned in managing the program. Forty delegates from 14 countries attended this past year’s workshop, and discussed issues ranging from decentralized donor data entry in Madagascar to Kosovo’s newly-released [AMP Public View platform](http://www.amp-mei.net "Kosovo Public AMP").

Read the workshop report ([English](/old-files/webfm/pdfs/2010_amp_best_practices_workshop_report_-_final.pdf "2010 AMP Best practices Workshop Report (English)"), [French](/old-files/webfm/pdfs/2010_amp_best_practices_workshop_report_-_final_fr.pdf "2010 AMP Best practices Workshop Report (French)")) to learn more about the event and how the Aid Management Program is helping governments gather, access, and monitor information on development aid activities.
