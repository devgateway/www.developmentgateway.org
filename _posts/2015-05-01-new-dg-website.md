The Development Gateway team is pleased to roll out a new, redesigned website!

Incorporating revitalized DG branding, streamlined messaging, and optimization for low-bandwidth environments, we hope the new site will provide visitors with a positive user experience, spur conversations, and better support the broader DG community. Key new features include a highly interactive [Reach page](/reach/), sleek [Expertise section](/expertise/), and a narrative-style [homepage](/).

As the title suggests, the site is currently in Beta – and we welcome feedback. Responses to our [User Acceptance Survey](https://docs.google.com/a/developmentgateway.org/forms/d/1U5NaYjvMkmROAWwQFHETUZAqjfqvuvowiCXRkDGkYX4/viewform), as well as messages via email or [social media](http://twitter.com/dgateway), are much appreciated. Phase II of the site will include enhanced interactivity, imagery, and more – stay tuned for the next iteration.
