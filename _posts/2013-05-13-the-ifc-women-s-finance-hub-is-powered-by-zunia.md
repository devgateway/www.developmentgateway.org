Development Gateway is proud to announce that the [Women’s Finance Hub](http://www.womensfinancehub.org) is powered by our Zunia Knowledge Sharing Platform.

The Hub is an online platform to help advance access to finance for women-owned businesses by disseminating research and information on critical issues relevant to them. It will also act as a launch pad for discussions and collaborative groups who are involved in women entrepreneurship, and address gaps in data, promote collaboration in knowledge sharing, and highlight innovation and best practices in expanding women’s access to finance.

> Women-owned enterprises represent significant untapped economic potential,
>

> It will take much more than credit to unlock that potential. It will also be necessary to expand financial literacy, leverage best practices, and put in place policies and regulations that remove barriers to women’s participation in the economy. The Women’s Finance Hub will provide an important boost to global efforts in these areas.

The Women's Finance Hub is managed by the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group.
