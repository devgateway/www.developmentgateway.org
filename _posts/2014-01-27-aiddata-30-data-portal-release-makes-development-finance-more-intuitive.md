 AidData, a research and innovation lab that seeks to improve development outcomes by making development finance data more accessible and actionable, released the 3.0 version of the [aiddata.org portal](http://aiddata.org) during Global Transparency Week.

Building upon previous efforts to track all aid flows, the 3.0 data portal seeks to capture the total resource envelope available to countries to plan for their development in one interactive interface. Policymakers and practitioners are now able to compare data on over $40 trillion in remittances, foreign direct investment, and aid from 90 donor agencies. Private foundation grants and domestic public expenditure from developing countries will also be added in the coming months.

The [AidData 3.0 release](http://aiddata.org) is a major step forward in making aid information not only more transparent, but also more useful in advocacy, research, and decision making. (We hope you think so too. Let us know [here](mailto:info@developmentgateway.org).) Read below for more information and be sure to check out the capabilities of the new site.

**More Data**

- An expanded set of development finance flows including foreign direct investment and remittances
- Expanded data sources including OECD, IATI, donor and country systems
- Detailed transactional and project-level development finance data
- A leading source in tracking emerging donors and non-traditional aid flows
- *Will feature national budgets and private foundation flows in the coming months*

**New Tools**

- State-of-the-art GIS portal to create and share maps and charts, including pre-made maps in seven thematic areas
- Easy visualization of data through quick stats by donors, countries and sectors
- Queries for project-specific information now generate dashboards instead of tables

- Search-by-source function for easy analysis of a single data source

**Better Insights**
