Deploying National e-Procurement System with Support from Development Gateway Foundation, Government of Italy, World Bank



The Government of Tunisia will deploy a new national procurement system to streamline government purchasing and put government contract information online. The Development Gateway Foundation will fund the project through its e-Government Grants Program backed by the Government of Italy. The World Bank is also providing co-funding.

Tunisia will use the combined funding of $580,000 to create a new internal information management system to improve national procurement processes. A connected public website will also be created to publish government tenders and provide online procurement training. This is the first phase of the countryâ€™s larger e-procurement plan, aimed at increasing transparency in government purchasing and cutting procurement costs.
