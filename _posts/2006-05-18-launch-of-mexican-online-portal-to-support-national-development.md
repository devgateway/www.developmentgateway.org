The Mexican Council for Economic and Social Development ([COMDES](http://www.consejomexicano.com/)), in cooperation with the Internet Office of the President of Mexico and 30 other organizations, today launched a national web portal to promote cooperation, transparency and civil society participation in Mexico’s economic development efforts. Called the Mexican Development Gateway, it is part of the international network of Country Gateways supported by the Development Gateway Foundation in Washington, D.C.

The initiative was launched at the Presidential Residence of Los Pinos before hundreds of participants from the public and private sectors, at Mexico’s Internet Celebration Day.

The portal creates an online platform for people to exchange information and best practices on social and economic development programs in Mexico. It also aims to strengthen dialogue and ties between organizations in the private and public sectors, while giving a channel to civil society organizations wishing to publish their ideas and views on specific issues. An editorial board among the partners has been created to ensure the objectivity and independence of information on the portal.

Major partners include Ashoka, Consejo Coordinador Empresarial, ENDEAVOR, Instituto Mexicano para la Competitividad, Transparencia Mexicana (the national chapter of Transparency International) and the Unión de Empresarios para la Tecnología en la Educación, among others.

“The launch of this portal is a reflection of a new attitude in Mexico that began with the passing of the Freedom of Information Act in 2002 and more recently the federal law to promote the activities of civil society organizations,” said Oscar Braun, President of COMDES. “Thanks to growing use of the internet, even new organizations can quickly learn and take action together to benefit Mexico in a way that we have never seen before.”
