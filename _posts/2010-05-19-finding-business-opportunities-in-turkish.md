After experiencing economic downturn in Turkey, businessman Metin Erdogou wanted to create change. He established dgMarket Ihale Bilmi Merkezi — a nonprofit organization based in Istanbul — and worked with DGF to launch a Turkish-language version of the dgMarket global tender publishing system.

“Government contracting is always a good source of business,” said Mr. Erdogou. “But before the Internet it was not easy for Turkish companies to get timely information on tender opportunities, particularly from foreign countries,” said Mr. Erdogou.

The site was an immediate success. There are now more than 30,000 registered users of dgMarket in Turkey. Three staff members of dgMarket Ihale Bilmi Merkezi do tender research and post Turkish notices onto the site, while one staff member markets the site, mainly through online channels.
