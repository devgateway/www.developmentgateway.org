WASHINGTON— Development Gateway announced today that it has redesigned the Accessible Information on Development Activities (AiDA) database to make information more accessible to users.

The new design of the site helps give visitors a full picture of development activities as information is now grouped by country, sector, and donor. The site is visually more appealing, easier to use, automatically updated, and enables the visitor to save search results.

“By adding these new features, we’ve made AiDA a more robust aid effectiveness tool,” said Riccardo De Marchi, who manages its development. The database advances the aid effectiveness agenda by giving donors the opportunity to harmonize their aid efforts.

Marc Tocatlian, administrator of the statistics and monitoring division of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said, “The “browse by” function brings great value added, allowing users to easily identify the available records for a specific country, sector, or agency. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been actively involved in the development of AiDA from the beginning.

Development Gateway launched AiDA in 2001. Its aid effectiveness steering committee guides the development of the tool and is comprised of representatives from the World Bank, United Nations Development Program, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. AiDA has information on more than 600,000 activities from traditional and non-traditional donors.
