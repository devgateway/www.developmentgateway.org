The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation will contribute $1.45 million over the next three years in support of the Development Gateway Foundation’s efforts to provide Internet solutions for more effective aid and efficient governance in developing countries.

The goal of this funding corresponds to the objectives of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development. The funds will be used to help implement the Foundation’s Web-based Aid Management Platform in several partner countries, enabling governments to better track, coordinate and manage international aid programs. Funds will also provide seed financing for new country-specific Internet portals to share development information and promote Web-based tools.

“In keeping with our mandate, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation seeks to increase the impact of aid by harmonizing the efforts of partners providing development and humanitarian assistance,” said Walter Fust, director general of the SDC. “The Development Gateway Foundation is an able partner in creating and implementing information systems that help countries more effectively manage aid, while promoting transparency and economic equity.”

Mark Fleeton, CEO of the Development Gateway Foundation, said, “Switzerland is a leader in the promotion of information and communications technologies to further development goals. With this support we can reach more countries and meet growing demand for our programs.”

The Development Gateway Foundation will conduct a needs assessment as the first step toward implementation of the Aid Management Platform in the following SDC priority countries: Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Mali and Tanzania.
