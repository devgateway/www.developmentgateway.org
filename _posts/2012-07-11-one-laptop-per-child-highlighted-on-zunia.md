The latest in a series of original interviews on [Zunia.org](http://www.zunia.org/) features a [conversation with Christoph Derndorfer](http://expertperspectives.zunia.org/post/christoph-derndorfers-view-on-the-one-laptop-per-child-olpc-initiative/), editor of the independent blog [OLPC News](http://www.olpcnews.com/), which provides commentary and updates on the [One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)](http://one.laptop.org/) initiative. Christoph discusses how the project’s success should be evaluated, and lessons it suggests for ICT for Development (ICT4D) and ICT for Education (ICT4E) projects more broadly.

OLPC aims to “empower the world’s poorest children through education,” and more specifically, sets out the ambitious target of providing every child in developing countries with a rugged, low-cost, low-power, eco-friendly laptop loaded with books and educational materials. It began deploying its XO laptops around the world in 2007, and has distributed over 2 million across 42 countries thus far.
