Development Gateway is proud to announce that it is a [Grand Challenges Explorations](http://www.grandchallenges.org/Explorations/Pages/Introduction.aspx) winner, an initiative funded by the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx).

Development Gateway, in conjunction with its [Feedback Labs](http://feedbacklabs.org/) partners GroundTruth Initiative, Global Giving, and Ushahidi, will pursue an innovative global health and development research project, titled "Bridge building for the last mile: Education feedback loops in three Nairobi slums"**.**

Grand Challenges Explorations (GCE) funds individuals worldwide to explore ideas that can break the mold in how we solve persistent global health and development challenges. Development Gatewayâ€™s project is one of more than 80 Grand Challenges Explorations Round 11 grants announced today by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

To receive funding, Development Gateway and other Grand Challenges Explorations Round 11 winners demonstrated in a two-page online application a bold idea in one of five critical global heath and development topic areas that included development of interoperability in social good data, agriculture development, and neglected tropical diseases.

Development Gateway's proposal has an ambitious goal: combine citizen-generated data with official government data in a way that allows slum dwellers to access and use this information to make decisions to improve their community. We aim to demonstrate a fix for the broken feedback loops that exist in philanthropy and development.

The use case will focus on education data in three slums of Kenya: Kibera, Mathare, and Mukuru. Our initial test case and geographic scope are very focused on areas where the consortium has extensive experience. However, the methodology and technology we introduce will allow anyone to deliver this kind of information across platforms and contexts, worldwide.
