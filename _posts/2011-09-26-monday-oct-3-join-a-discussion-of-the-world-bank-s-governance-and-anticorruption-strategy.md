On Monday, Oct. 3 (10 AM EST), Development Gateway will host a discussion with the author of a new report by the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) on the World Bank’s governance and anti-corruption strategy. 

The idea that well-governed countries are better able to foster economic opportunities, deliver services to the poor, and fight corruption became prominent among aid agencies in the 1990s. In 2007, the Bank’s governance and anticorruption (GAC) strategy reaffirmed its commitment to supporting country efforts to develop accountable and effective states. Entering its fourth year of implementation, the strategy seeks to increase the number of programs and projects addressing GAC issues.

The IEG study assesses the relevance and the effectiveness of the World Bank's 2007 strategy. A key feature is its benchmarking of the Bank’s country-level engagement on GAC issues, before and after the 2007 strategy. To improve performance, the study recommends a number of innovations: new financial instruments, better ways of measuring governance performance, a more harmonized and consistent approach to risk management, and a more strategic allocation of the World Bank’s internal resources.

Navin Girishankar, who led the study, will present its findings on whether the World Bank is contributing to good governance in developing countries, whether the strategy is making a difference, and the lessons learned for the broader development community. 

Please join us to discuss this important topic.
