The [China Development Gateway](http://en.chinagate.cn/ "China Development Gateway") (CnDG), located in Beijing, has launched the first stage of the "China Poverty Relief Forum" in partnership with the Development Gateway Foundation. The new all-Chinese dgCommunity, announced in December at the GK3 Conference in Malaysia, will provide a unique venue for knowledge sharing and collaboration among development practitioners working in the Chinese language.



Key development related agencies, including the China Poverty Relief Foundation, the All China Confederation of Women, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the European Association of Industry & Commerce, have already joined as Cooperating Organizations. The platform, to be managed by CnDG, will facilitate discussion and exchange on development issues of importance to China including health, environment, and economic and social development. The platform will also provide an exceptional opportunity for new linkage between Chinese development practitioners and the wider international development community.
