The Development Gateway Foundation announced today the appointment of Travis Harvey as the new program coordinator for the Asia-Pacific region.

In his new role, Mr. Harvey will be the Asia-Pacific representative for the foundation and will be responsible for overseeing the planning, implementation, and evaluation of programs in the region, across all the business lines. He will lead the foundation’s efforts to promote the use of tools such as the Aid Management Platform, a web-based system that helps developing country governments and their donors manage international aid more efficiently, and dgMarket, an online government tender information system that is already saving billions of dollars for developing country governments. Promotion and implementation of these tools in different countries will leverage the foundation’s network of local Country Gateway partners, in addition to direct work with the respective national governments.

The establishment of regional coordinator is part of a larger strategy to strengthen the foundation’s presence in the field. In 2006, Jean Philbert Nsengimana of Rwanda assumed the position of regional coordinator for Africa.

Mr. Harvey has been associated with the foundation for over four years. In 2003, he spent 12 months working with the Mongolia Country Gateway as a business development and capacity building manager, as part of volunteer program funded by the Australian aid agency. In 2005, he worked with the [Australian Country Gateway](http://www.developmentgateway.com.au "Opens external link in new window") as the Web site manager, developing new content, establishing strategic partnerships, and building the site’s user base to an average of 35,000+ visitors per month. Since 2006, he has been involved in the creation of a new country gateway in Samoa (the first in the Pacific region).

Mr. Harvey has a bachelor’s degree in communications from the University of Canberra and is working on his master’s degree in development studies from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.
