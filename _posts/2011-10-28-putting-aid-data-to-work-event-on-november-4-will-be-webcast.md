On November 4, [AidData](http://www.aiddata.org/ "AidData Portal"), the [Climate Change and African Political Stability](http://ccaps.strausscenter.org/ "CCAPS") (CCAPS) program, and the [World Bank Institute](http://wbi.worldbank.org/ "World Bank Institute") will co-host an all-day event to highlight trends in open data and aid transparency, and how they are influencing work on climate change and other issues, leading to better development results on the ground. The event will mark the launch of AidData 2.0, with a preview of the new AidData website and a new direction for the AidData program that focuses on transparency, innovation, and country and donor solutions for aid effectiveness.

Richard Manning, former Chair of the OECD Development Assistance Committee and Chair of the PARIS21 Consortium Scientific Committee, will give the keynote address. A series of panel discussions will explore the open data movement, tracking aid flows, applications for climate change and development, and innovations in grassroots monitoring of aid. Specific initiatives discussed will include a pilot initiative by AidData, CCAPS, and the World Bank Institute working with the Government of Malawi to track all active aid within one country using interactive maps.

The event will be held at the World Bank in Washington, DC. Advance registration is required and closes at noon on Wed., Nov. 2.
