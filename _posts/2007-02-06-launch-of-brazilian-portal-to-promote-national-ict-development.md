Telemática e Desenvolvimento Ltda announced today the launch of the e-Brazil portal, a bilingual portal that is part of the international network of country gateways supported by the Development Gateway Foundation.

The e-Brazil portal, in English and Portuguese, brings together information and discussions related to the use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) to build a more equitable and more competitive Brazil. The goal is to show the contributions ICT organizations are making to achieve these two basic objectives. Another goal is to build consensus around public policies in support of these objectives.

“It is important in the socioeconomic development of the country that Brazilians have access to the most recent information about these technologies and how they can make a difference in their lives,” said Peter Knight of Telemática e Desenvolvimento Ltda., and coordinator of the e-Brazil project. “The portal facilitates knowledge sharing, and it highlights innovations in this sector.”

The domain of the e-Brazil portal was made available by the Brazilian Chamber of Electronic Commerce, which used it for the publication of the work of the first e-Brazil project carried out in 2002 and 2003. In September 2006, the chamber adopted the e-Brazil program as its own.

The e-Brazil portal is part of the Country Gateway Network. Its development is supported by Banco Hoje, Brisa, Fenadados, Camara-e.net, Matemart Computação, Telemática e Desenvolvimento Ltda, and the Development Gateway Foundation.
