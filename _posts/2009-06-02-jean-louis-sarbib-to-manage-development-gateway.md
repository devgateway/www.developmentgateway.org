WASHINGTON—Development Gateway announces today that Jean-Louis Sarbib will serve as Chief Executive Officer following the departure of Mark Fleeton earlier this year.

"Jean-Louis has a keen understanding of this organization and has been a strong supporter of the aid effectiveness agenda and the role of information and communications technologies in development," according to Mary O’Kane, vice chair of the board and executive chairman of Mary O’Kane *&* Associates of Australia. "We are fortunate he accepted this position at the request of the executive committee."

Mr. Sarbib has taken a leave of absence from his position of managing director at Wolfensohn *&* Company, a private investment firm and a strategic advisor to corporations and governments. Previously, he held senior positions at the World Bank including senior vice president and head of the human development network, regional vice president for the Middle East and North Africa, and regional vice president for Africa.

"This is an opportunity to lead an organization that has evolved considerably since its inception in 2000 at a time when aid transparency and aid effectiveness are near the top of the agenda," said Mr. Sarbib. "I am honored that the board has given me its confidence and delighted at the idea of working closely with the Gateway’s dedicated, competent, and innovative staff."

In 2004, Mr. Sarbib joined the Development Gateway Foundation board of directors where he serves on the executive committee. The board selected him to serve as chair when the previous chair Dr. Michael Hofmann stepped down after being named executive director of the World Bank for Germany.

A French national, Mr. Sarbib also serves on the boards of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI Alliance), The Micronutrient Initiative, World Links for Development, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and The International Center for Conciliation.
