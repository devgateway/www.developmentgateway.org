Last week, the Ugandan Government made public its [Development Assistance Management System](http://www.finance.go.ug/amp/portal), which tracks all external development assistance projects in the country. This system is a technical part of the country's [Aid Management Program (AMP)](/programs/aid-management-program).

Overseen by the Ugandan Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development, Secretary Keith Muhahanizi reaffirmed on Friday that the system:

*“... is part of Government’s commitment to transparency, accountability and aid effectiveness, providing in-depth and up-to-date information on how external support is being used to drive social and economic development across the country.”*

Featuring all ongoing on-budget projects since Fiscal Year 2007/08, as well as a [geocoded map](http://154.72.196.70/esrigis/mainmap.do) that “reveal[s] stories about aid that might otherwise be difficult to observe,” the platform is officially open and ready for business.

Development Gateway is proud to have partnered with the Government of Uganda to make aid information more accessible and transparent, and is grateful for the support of the United Nations Development Programme, the USAID Higher Education Solutions Network, and AidData.
