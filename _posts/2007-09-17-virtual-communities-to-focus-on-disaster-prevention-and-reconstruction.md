The Development Gateway Foundation announces today a new partnership with the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](http://www.csis.org/ "Opens external link in new window") (CSIS) to establish online communities dedicated to disaster prevention and reconstruction.

These new portals will provide a virtual space in which participants can share knowledge, best practices, and other relevant information. The purpose of this initiative is to build capacity, strengthen working relationships, and improve development outcomes. Particular emphasis will be placed on bringing together government agencies and international and nongovernmental organizations in developed and developing countries to discuss common challenges.

"CSIS is one of the most prestigious think tanks in Washington and is relied upon by many top practitioners in government, the private sector, and the international community," said Mark Fleeton, CEO of the Development Gateway Foundation. "Working together there is much we can do to improve results in these critical areas. We are confident this project will be the beginning of a long and fruitful collaboration for both organizations."
