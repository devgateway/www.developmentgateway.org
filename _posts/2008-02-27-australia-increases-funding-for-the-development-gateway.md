The government of Australia will contribute $6.9 million (AUS$7.5 million) to the Development Gateway Foundation in support of its mission to reduce poverty through information technology.

Australia was a founding contributor of the foundation and ranks as its largest donor. This is its third round of financial support and represents a substantial increase in its funding of the foundation over the next three years.

This commitment reflects Australia’s recognition that information and communications technology can be a key tool in enhancing of aid effectiveness. The contribution will enable the foundation to expand its programming, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.

“Australia has long been a leading supporter of information and communications technologies for development,” said Mark Fleeton, CEO of the Development Gateway Foundation. “We are grateful for Australia’s continuing strong support which comes at a very strategic time for the international aid effectiveness agenda: as both donor and partner governments strive to achieve expanded aid volume commitments; with the emergence of new private and government donors; and in the lead up to the September 2008 High Level Meeting on Aid Effectiveness in Ghana.”
