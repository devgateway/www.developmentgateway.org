Development Gateway is delighted to welcome The Gambia to the global [Aid Management Program](/programs/aid-management-program) (AMP) family, joining over 25 countries worldwide dedicated to better tracking and managing aid flows. The Gambia is our 17th African partner government, and joins 20+ UNDP-supported AMP implementations. We are looking forward to a fruitful partnership in the years to come.

Development Gateway conducted an initial needs assessment in earlier this year, during which we met with various stakeholders including government ministry staff, local civil society organizations, and several funding agencies including UNDP, the EU, and other UN agencies. The assessment culminated with specific recommendations regarding how to implement the Aid Management Platform – AMP’s software tool – with a specific focus on transparency to avoid duplication of efforts and improve partnerships. The government will also work to connect AMP with their Internal Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), which will provide the Ministry of Finance and other policymakers with a more complete picture of the resources dedicated to promoting development in The Gambia.
