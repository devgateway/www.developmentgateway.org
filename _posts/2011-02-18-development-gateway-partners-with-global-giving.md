Development Gateway has recently partnered with GlobalGiving, a non-profit that connects donors with non-profits around the world through their online marketplace. Through the GlobalGiving website donors are able to connect with projects and regions that interest them, and support the communities and ideas they find important. The GlobalGiving team also works with local partners to collect feedback from ordinary citizens on both GlobalGiving and non-GlobalGiving affiliated projects.

Development Gateway and GlobalGiving intend to explore a number of projects together, including connecting local feedback to publicly accessible information on aid projects. Global Giving collects reports from beneficiary communities on their opinions of development projects. Development Gateway and GlobalGiving will work together to explore connecting this feedback not only to GlobalGiving projects, but other aid projects as well.
