These new portals will provide a virtual space in which participants can share knowledge, best practices, and other relevant information. The purpose of this initiative is to build capacity, strengthen working relationships, and improve development outcomes. Particular emphasis will be placed on bringing together government agencies and international and nongovernmental organizations in developed and developing countries to discuss common challenges.

"The cyclone in Myanmar and the earthquake in China have reminded us all of the need for more effective knowledge sharing and partnership on these critical topics," said Mark Fleeton, CEO of the Development Gateway Foundation.

“Stabilization and reconstruction as well as disaster response are complex challenges. They require swift and efficient integration from analysis to strategy to action among a wide range of actors,” explained Rick Barton, senior adviser and co-director of the Post-Conflict Reconstruction Project at CSIS. “We are proud to be part of an effort that helps generate such collaboration.”

More than 40,000 students and development professionals are members of dgCommunities, a knowledge-sharing and collaboration network, where users post up-to-date information on 30 topics.
