In December 2010, development practitioners convened for [European Development Days](http://www.eudevdays.eu/ "European Development Days") (EDD), a forum for discussion on and creation of new development policies and practices.

Jean-Louis Sarbib, CEO of Development Gateway, was interviewed at the event by [capacity4dev.eu](http://capacity4dev.ec.europa.eu/ "Capacity4Dev"), an online knowledge-sharing community for development practitioners.

Mr. Sarbib speaks during the interview on the importance of promoting information and communications technologies (ICTs) in developing countries. According to Mr. Sarbib, “it is essential to share information” so that development actors can coordinate projects, gain access to vital resources, and avoid reinventing the wheel. Capacity4dev.eu, in its [discussion](http://capacity4dev.ec.europa.eu/article/digital-advances-make-information-sharing-indispensible-component-development "Capacity4Dev") of Mr. Sarbib's interview, highlights the expanding access to information-sharing technologies in developing nations, particularly those in Africa, where mobile phone use increased by 550% between 2003 and 2008.

Both Development Gateway and Capacity4dev.eu work to promote online knowledge exchange and networking, using technology as a tool for, rather than a product of, development.
