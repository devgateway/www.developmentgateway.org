title: 'China’s Development Finance to Africa: A Media-Based Approach to Data Collection'
lede: How big is China’s aid to Africa? Does it complement or undermine the efforts
  of traditional donors? China releases little information and outside estimates of
  the size and nature of Chinese aid vary widely. In an effort to overcome this problem,
  AidData has compiled a database of thousands of media reports on Chinese-backed
  projects in Africa from 2000-2011. The database includes information on 1,673 projects
  in 51 African countries, and $75 billion in commitments of official finance.

How big is China’s aid to Africa? Does it complement or undermine the efforts of traditional donors? China releases little information and outside estimates of the size and nature of Chinese aid vary widely. In an effort to overcome this problem, AidData has compiled a database of thousands of media reports on Chinese-backed projects in Africa from 2000-2011. The database includes information on 1,673 projects in 51 African countries, and $75 billion in commitments of official finance.

The Center for Global Development will be releasing a working paper based on the AidData efforts that describes the new database methodology, key findings, and possible applications and limitations of the data, which is being made publicly available for the first time. The paper and database offer a new toolset for researchers, policymakers, journalists, and civil society organizations working to understand China’s growing role in Africa.
