Development Gateway congratulates the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on winning a [Knowledge Management Award 2012](http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2012/06/14/undp-recognized-internationally-for-its-valuable-contributions-in-knowledge-management/#.T94K0njYd24.twitter) in Vienna, Austria for its “outstanding efforts and achievements to promote the idea of knowledge societies”. Each year, Knowledge Management Austria presents the [award](http://km-a.net/forschung/Pages/AgendaWissen2012.aspx) to one individual and one international organization. The Managing Director of Knowledge Management Austria, Mr. Andreas Brandner, mentioned [Teamworks](https://www.unteamworks.org/login) as a prime example of UNDP’s work in this area, calling it “the most promising knowledge management initiative within the UN focusing on knowledge networking within a global knowledge partnership.”

Development Gateway built the Teamworks platform for UNDP to improve collaboration within the organization by allowing UNDP staff to share their experiences and lessons learned. Teamworks is also being used as the platform for the [Rio+20 Dialogues](https://www.riodialogues.org/login) initiative in parallel with [Rio+20, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development](http://www.uncsd2012.org/).
