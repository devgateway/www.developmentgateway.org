    Ensuring that people can access and use development data for good.
  </h3>

  <p>
    Data is important, but only matters for development if people can use it effectively. DG works with partners to make data open, accessible, and useful â€“ built many open data tools and specialize in international data standards like IATI, OCDS, and EITI. We also offer tools and innovative training that help people in governments and development organizations use data and tech to improve their work.
