    Ensuring that people can access and use development data for good.
  </h3>

    DG works with partners to make data open, accessible, and useful. We build open data tools, specialize in international data standards (like IATI, OCDS, and EITI), and offer trainings that help people in governments and organizations use data and tech to improve their work.
