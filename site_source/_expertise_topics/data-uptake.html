    Understanding and communicating how data and technology can promote impact. 
  </h3>

  <p>
    Technology for development efforts are most successful when donors and implementers understand how technology and data can inform real decisions in a particular organization, place, or sector. We conduct forward-thinking studies, data analyses, assessments, and evaluations, and share our learnings widely.

  <h3><span class="blue">Case Study:</span> Results Data Initiative</h3>

  <p>
    A much-needed “diagnosis” of the ways that development actors collect, share and use information about development results. With support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, this initiative focuses on results data for health and agriculture in three countries -- Sri Lanka, Ghana, and Tanzania. DG is asking over 400 government, donor and implementer representatives in these countries about the results data they collect and use. We are also taking results indicators from 20 donors and showing how these can be compared, combined and used to promote collective impact. <a href="/expertise/results/">Read more about RDI</a>.
