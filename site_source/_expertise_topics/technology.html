    The Information Management System (IMS) improves coordination throughout the United Nations. With user-friendly data entry modules, UN staff in over 130 countries can both fulfill reporting requirements and easily visualize and export this information to evaluate program performance and strategic alignment. An API displays select data on a public-facing platform, better communicating the UN Development Group’s strategic goals and programmatic work to the world. <a href="https://ims.undg.org/public/maps">Visit UNDG IMS.</a>
