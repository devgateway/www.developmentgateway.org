  <p><em>The international development community is serious about measuring impact – especially as focus turns to the new slate of Sustainable Development Goals. But results management is tailored to the needs of specific projects, donors, and implementing agencies, and this data is not readily shared or communicated between donors and with government and other stakeholders. We plan to investigate how development results information can be more effectively collected, managed, shared and used across agencies and implementers to inform better development outcomes.</em></p>

  <h3 class= "blue">The Issue</h3>

  <p>Development agencies, NGOs, and governments spend considerable effort and money gathering data on thousands of indicators embedded in the various levels of Results Frameworks – comprising <em>outputs</em> (school enrollment, immunization figures, etc.), as well as program <em>outcomes</em> (educational attainment, disease prevalence), and, in some cases, <em>impacts</em> (changes in key outcomes over time).</p>

  <p>Ostensibly, governments and donors use results data to allocate aid to the places, partners, and programs that are most likely to achieve lasting success. But is this data good enough – and is it used well enough – to genuinely increase the impact of development finance in priority areas?</p>

  <p>Experience suggests that development results information is often not managed or used as effectively as it could be, and that decision-makers may often be faced with incorrect, old, inappropriate, or incomplete results data. These data users face a figurative “Tower of Babel” of both program-level M&E data and results/outcome information (spanning projects, donors, agencies, and sectors) that is difficult to aggregate, compare, and use.</p>

  <p>We suggest that the development community needs to do more to (1) enhance the quality of results data at all levels of results frameworks, and (2) make this data – especially results/outcome data – more accessible and useful, particularly across multiple implementing and funding organizations.</p>

  <h3 class="blue">Our Initiative</h3>

  <p>To this end, Development Gateway (DG), with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is working on a <strong>diagnosis of the global results data ecosystem</strong> to identify the best ways to improve the quality and utility of results data in the <strong>health</strong> and <strong>agriculture</strong> sectors. Our effort will seek to answer a number of critical questions, such as:
   <ul>
   <li>How do we make existing results data more useful for governments, donors, and implementers?</li>
   <li>What institutional and technical barriers prevent results data from being collected, analyzed, and used to maximum effect?</li> What will it take to address these challenges?</li>
   <li>Are the distinctions between results, outputs, and activity reporting clear?</li>
   <li>How can existing results data be compared, aggregated, and harmonized across agencies to inform better policy choices at donor and country level?</li>
   <li>Are we realistically recognizing, reporting, and learning from ‘bad’ results?</li>
   </ul>

 <p>Our end goal is to illustrate how higher-quality results can be obtained, and to demonstrate immediate, practical applications for each level of results data that can improve government and donor decision-making processes.</p>

 <p>To achieve these goals, this initiative will include two key elements:</p>

{% multicols %}

  <h2 class="blue">Component I:</h2>

  <--colbreak-->

  <h3 class="blue"><em>A detailed qualitative look at the results management “ecosystem” in three countries: Ghana, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka.</em></h3>

{% endmulticols %}

 <p>DG aims to “paint a picture” of how results data are <strong>collected, managed, shared, and used</strong> by donors, government, and implementers in each country. To do this, DG will document the nature of results data at two levels: the project/program level (primarily output data) and the government/donor level (primarily outcome data). We will uncover any obstacles that prevent effective data collection and sharing, as well as “success stories” that demonstrate the impact of good results data on development planning and performance. We will conduct local workshops to discuss the findings with government officials, donors and implementers, working toward consensus on recommended ways forward for both country and donor results systems.</p>

{% multicols %}

  <h2 class="blue">Component II:</h2>

  <--colbreak-->

  <h3 class="blue"><em>A quantitative “crosswalk” of data from multiple donors across two priority sectors: health and agriculture.</em></h3>

{% endmulticols %}

 <p>Our goal is to highlight what donors can do to use <em>existing output data and results/outcome information</em> more effectively – or, in other words, how can we begin to translate these results data into a coherent, usable source of knowledge on what works? The “crosswalk” will explore how data from various agencies can be “joined up” to aid cross-donor and cross-country analysis of results. We will also endeavor to sketch out the beginnings of a more standardized approach for reporting harmonized output/outcome data across the development community.</p>

 <p>DG will communicate key findings throughout the process, concluding with an event in Washington, DC, to discuss important implications for the results agenda and chart a way forward.</p>

 <h3 class="blue">Long-Term Vision</h3>

 <p>Our initiative is intended to expand knowledge of the local, country-level, and international constraints surrounding results management. Findings will inform a roadmap for improving the quality and comparability of results information, and for using and sharing existing results indicator data more effectively. This roadmap should ultimately lead to more effective resource allocation by governments and donors, attainment of country level development goals, and better-informed program implementations.</p>
