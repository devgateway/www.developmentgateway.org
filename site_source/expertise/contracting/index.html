  <h3 class="blue-vibrant">Helping government and citizens to combat corruption and gain better value for money.</h3>

  <h3 class="blue">The Issue</h3>

  <p>Each year, governments spend trillions of dollars through public procurement of goods and services. Much of that funding is lost through waste or corruption. <b>Effective harvesting and analysis of procurement data can revolutionize public procurement</b> markets and <b>give citizens confidence</b> that their governments are spending tax money wisely. </p>

  <h3 class="blue">Our Vision</h3>

  <p>DG provides a line of tools and services aimed at helping governments and citizens leverage public procurement data to improve service delivery. Our holistic approach addresses i) legal and regulatory frameworks; ii) technical infrastructure; iii) data management and requirements, and iv) institutional and political support in public procurement.</p>

  <p>At the core of our vision lies our Open Contracting Explorer, an open source tool for storing, disclosing, and analyzing procurement data. We take data directly from government sources and convert and publish data in the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS), allowing data to be viewed through a suite of interactive tools for data visualization and in-depth analytics.</p>

  <p><b>Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Dashboard</b> for finding insight on the efficiency, competitiveness, and fairness of procurement practices using interactive charts, graphs, and web GIS.</p>

  <p><b>Corruption Risk Dashboard</b> using high powered analytics and global research to identify risk profiles for potential corruption in procurement. This red flagging tool can assist governments in selecting which procurement activities merit in-depth auditing or public scrutiny.</p>

  <p><b>Contract Explorer</b> for “following the money” from program planning, through tendering, award, contract, and implementation stages for individual contracts.</p>
