      <p>The Aid Management Platform is a software solution allowing governments and donor partners manage aid
        activities and flows through the planning, implementation, and evaluation stages. </p>

      <p>Through online workspaces, interactive dashboards, and report generation mechanisms, decision-makers are
        empowered to make informed decisions and allocate resources where most needed.</p>

      <h4 class="title-bordered">Data Uptake</h4>

      <p>Technology solutions alone are not sufficient to bring about lasting change: technology should be adopted as
        part of a larger effort that brings partners together, puts sustainable management processes in place, and
        ensures long-term technical maintenance. </p>

      <p>For this reason, the Aid Management Program includes hands-on training programs, drafting data management
        plans, ongoing technical support, and an annual Good Practices Workshop.</p>

      <h4 class="title-bordered">Openness & Engagement</h4>

      <p>Development Gateway encourages our government partners to open up aid information to the public through
        accessible Aid Management Platform public portals.</p>

      <p>By making this financial information more transparent, governments increase their domestic and international
        credibility; can leverage public scrutiny to hold donors accountable; and step closer to closing the feedback
        loop by facilitating public debate and discourse.</p>
