  description: >
    The Aid Management Platform is a software solution allowing governments and donor partners manage aid activities and flows through the planning, implementation, and evaluation stages.
    Through online workspaces, interactive dashboards, and report generation mechanisms, decision-makers are empowered to make informed decisions and allocate resources where most needed.

- title: Data Uptake
  description: >
    Technology solutions alone are not sufficient to bring about lasting change: technology should be adopted as part of a larger effort that brings partners together, puts sustainable management processes in place, and ensures long-term technical maintenance.
    For this reason, the Aid Management Program includes hands-on training programs, drafting data management plans, ongoing technical support, and an annual Good Practices Workshop.

- title: Openness & Engagement
  description: >
    Development Gateway encourages our government partners to open up aid information to the public through accessible Aid Management Platform public portals.
    By making this financial information more transparent, governments increase their domestic and international credibility; can leverage public scrutiny to hold donors accountable; and step closer to closing the feedback loop by facilitating public debate and discourse.
