When we ask for personally identifiable information, it is used only to provide the information you have requested as well as other key announcements from Development Gateway.
  
    Statistical Data: We collect statistical information based upon the behavior of users of our Portal. We use this information only to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests and preferences, and to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. None of this information can identify you as an individual. This information may include referring URLs (such as search engines), the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the website or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the website or not), the time you spent on our website, which country you accessed our website from, your computer browser and browser language, operating system information, your resolution/screen size and your IP address.

3. Use and Disclosure of Information

    Personally Identifiable Information: When you are on an area of [http://www.developmentgateway.org](http://www.developmentgateway.org) or [http://www.dginternational.org](http://www.dginternational.org) or a subdomain and are asked for personally identifiable information, such as when subscribing to the Development Gateway newsletter, you are providing that information to Development Gateway.

    We use your personally identifiable information to facilitate the services you request (e.g., to receive the Development Gateway newsletter).
As a matter of policy, we do not rent or sell any of your personally identifiable information to any third parties. Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this privacy policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personally identifiable information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private.

    Statistical data: We are currently using Google Analytics to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer our website in order to constantly improve the website quality. Google Analytics uses cookies to help track visitor behavior.

    Development Gateway reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding our visitors and users for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for potential sponsors of our work.

The website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.

Your information is stored on Development Gateway’s servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personally identifiable information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy.

    While we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, no data transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be 100% secure. Thus, Development Gateway cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information during transmission to or from our website, and you submit information to us at your own risk. However we do our best to ensure the highest level of security on our systems.
