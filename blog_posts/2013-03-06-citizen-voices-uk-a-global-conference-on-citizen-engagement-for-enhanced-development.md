The World Bank, Development Gateway, and Plan UK [invite you to RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1M_FrKYUHSt0G39QR4zI2K2AFi0FNpVxGRLBe-SfmRBA/viewform) for Citizen Voices UK: A Global Conference on Citizen Engagement for Enhanced Development Impact.

Citizen Voices UK will focus on citizen engagement and feedback systems that strengthen the quality of policy making and the science of service delivery, and where the impact on the poor is most direct.

 The morning-long London conference will build on [the Washington, DC event](http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/event/citizen-voices) to position the citizen engagement agenda as essential for effective development, move practitioners from knowledge to action, and establish concrete partnerships for scaling up at global and national levels

 The conference will bring together tech innovators, development specialists, government officials, academics, civil society representatives, World Bank staff and the private sector where experience with client feedback systems is the deepest.

 We will open with [Martin Tisné](http://www.omidyar.com/team/martin-tisn%C3%A9), Omidyar Network, leading us in a conversation on the results we are looking to achieve with citizen feedback, followed by three sessions that will include discussions exploring:

1. Which innovative uses of technology can be transformational?
2. What can we learn from the private sector?
3. How can governments be more responsive?  

 The conference will close by generating ideas for how we proceed as a collective in advancing the citizen engagement agenda.
