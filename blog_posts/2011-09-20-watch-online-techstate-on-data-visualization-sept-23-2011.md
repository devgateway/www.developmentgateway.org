The next Tech@State event will be held on Friday, Sept. 23, 2011, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and will focus on Data Visualization. [Registration](http://techatstateday1.eventbrite.com/ "Tech@State Registration") is open to the public, and the event will also be streamed [live on the internet](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/tech-state "Tech@State Live Streaming"). It will be followed by an informal “unconference” on Sept. 24 (held at the Microsoft Innovation & Policy Center) to allow participants to brainstorm, network, and create their own agenda together.

Tech@State: Data Visualization is organized by the [U.S. Department of State](http://www.state.gov "U.S. Department of State"), Development Gateway, [AidData](http://www.aiddata.org "AidData Portal"), and the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery](http://www.gfdrr.org "GFDRR"). Speakers and panelists will explore new and innovative data visualization techniques, and their applications for international development research and practice.

[Edward Tufte](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_1azZA2OY "Edward Tufte: Beautiful Evidence (Highlights)") will get the discussions started with a keynote address on Policy and Technology. Other expert panelists will address the open data movement and how to leverage visualization techniques for planning, implementing, and monitoring aid projects. Breakout sessions will focus on key sectors and themes, including: data visualization to support disaster response and coordination; visualization for aid transparency; mobile technology and new media; and others. The full agenda and further details are available at [http://tech.state.gov](http://tech.state.gov "Tech@State"). You can also follow the discussions using the Twitter hashtag [\#techATstate](http://twitter.com/#!/techATState "#techATState").

This event is made possible through support from the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery](http://www.gfdrr.org "GFDRR") (GFDRR), [Fitzgerald Analytics](http://www.fitzgerald-analytics.com "Fitzgerald Analytics"), [Esri](http://www.esri.com "Esri"), [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com "Microsoft Corporation"), and [MetroStar Systems](http://www.metrostarsystems.com "MetroStar Systems"). It is part of a series of Tech@State events, which bring together leaders, innovators, government personnel and others to collaborate on 21st century technology solutions to improve the education, health and welfare of the world's population.
