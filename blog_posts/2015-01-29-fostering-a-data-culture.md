*This post continues coverage of breakout sessions held at the 7th Annual Aid Management program Good Practices Workshop in Kathmandu, Nepal.*

At the crux of the Data Revolution is an increased use of data for government decision making. However, this tenet is often coupled with the assumption that a data-driven culture already exists.

*The Importance of Access*

When asked how domestic data use could be ramped up, a representative from the Government of Malawi underscored the need for accessible data. Infrastructure limitations, such as spotty Internet connectivity or expensive technology, curb the ability to review – let alone analyze – information. In Malawi’s case, the government is currently grappling with making technology and accessibility affordable.

But is having both data and citizens online enough?

*Encouraging Data-Driven Decision Making*

Increased data availability does not guarantee an increased uptake or usage. As pointed out by a Government of Niger representative, removing access constraints does not automatically shift a bureaucratic or civic culture. Using data in decision making is a skill that needs to be learned, just as much as cleaning or verifying datasets and it requires a supportive culture.

So how do we shift from qualitative to quantitative decision making? With partner governments, Development Gateway is working to catalyze data uptake through identifying “data champions” – high-ranking officials in government departments who push their peers towards data-driven decision making. Importantly, building a data culture and improving accessibility are not mutually exclusive; both can be tackled in tandem, and are vital to making the Data Revolution work for everyone.
