In biology, ecosystems are a group of organisms defined by a network of interactions. In the international realm, a data ecosystem can also be defined as a network of interactions – with governments, organizations, and individuals variously producing and using development information.

Keeping with this biological analogy, the “organisms” in our data ecosystem are dynamic entities: the data ecosystem is not binary, but dynamic in which all actors produce and use data for decision-making. This is especially true for government actors. While easy to accept as producers of data, it can be easy to overlook the numerous government officials who also use data to make impactful policy decisions.

To foster a stronger data ecosystem, Development Gateway [continues to engage with governments]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-04-14-the-gambia-joins-development-gateway-s-aid-management-family %}) to support country ownership of data for better decision-making; with [international organizations]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-03-31-governments-as-open-data-users-the-future-of-iati %}) dedicated to improving data interoperability and uptake; and with [innovative initiatives]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-03-05-launch-of-open-schools-kenya %}) that work to close the feedback loop between governments and citizens.

However, our focus is not only an external one; as [Development Gateway’s 2012-2014 Annual Report]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-03-24-a-new-development-gateway %}) shows, DG has come a long way over the past three years; a [refreshed website]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-05-01-new-dg-website %}) offers a visual representation of this evolution. As the world looks ahead to post-2015, DG will be steadily working to nurture a healthy data ecosystem for all.
