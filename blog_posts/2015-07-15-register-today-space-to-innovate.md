Technology is making the world smaller. It and big data are changing the way governments, organizations, and individuals interact with each other — offering both opportunities and challenges for 21st century leadership. Innovative processes, methods, and products — from smart apps, to cloud-based platforms, to social networking sites — help facilitate dialogue and share best practices.

Sustained, inclusive communication is important to promoting a prosperous transatlantic community. Technology can serve as a driver of change, fostering dialogue and leading to cooperative solutions. Ensuring these discussions bridge the gap between local operators and government policymakers can help fuel more resilient communities on both sides of the Atlantic.

[Next week, join Development Gateway and the Young Transatlantic Network of the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) at the OpenGov Hub for an evening with entrepreneurs and thought-leaders about how digital tools and innovative policies can create more efficient, integrated, and sustainable transatlantic communities for the 21st century.](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/space-to-innovate-how-technology-facilitates-transatlantic-cooperation-tickets-17726138357) Audience via social media ([#GMFYTN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GMFYTN&src=typd)) and conversation is encouraged.
