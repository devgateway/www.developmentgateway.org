This month, [dgMarket](http://www.dgmarket.com/) reached a new milestone – we now have over half a million users who can track almost $1 trillion in government procurements annually!

dgMarket is an online marketplace for government tenders, providing access to tender notices, bidding documents, and other procurement information. It also provides open information on some 1.6 million contract awards, in support of the [Open Contracting movement](/news/unleashing-open-contracting-benefits-open-standards).

Transparent contracting activities like dgMarket create major savings in government spending, while giving companies of all sizes greater access to tender opportunities at home and abroad in their own language. Our in-house analysis suggests that dgMarket has reduced national procurement costs by up to $150 million per year on World Bank-funded contracts alone. A big thank you to all our partners around the globe that have helped make dgMarket one of the largest global procurement portals.
