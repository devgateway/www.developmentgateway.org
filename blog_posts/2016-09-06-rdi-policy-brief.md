We are pleased to share our *[Policy Brief: Increasing the Impact of Results Data](http://www.developmentgateway.org/assets/post-resources/RDI-PolicyBrief.pdf)*, which distills findings from our [Results Data Initiative (RDI)](http://www.developmentgateway.org/expertise/results/). 

Following nearly 500 interviews in Ghana, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania, this [brief](http://www.developmentgateway.org/assets/post-resources/RDI-PolicyBrief.pdf) outlines insights on local attitudes toward – and use of – results data; the extent to which results influence policy and programs; and recommendations for improving future investments in results data.

As we continue pursuing a “data revolution” for sustainable development, we hope these insights help inform policy and programming decisions around development data. Specifically, we recommend future investments center around:
 - Creating incentives to use results data
 - Connecting resources with results
 - Sponsoring technologies that promote use – not just reporting
 - Generating local-level outcome data
 - Identifying and build up data leaders
 - Responding to local data demands
