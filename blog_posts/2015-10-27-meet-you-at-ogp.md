This week, DG is participating in the [Open Government Partnership’s 2015 Global Summit](http://ogpsummit.org/) in Mexico City. A triennial gathering of governments, civil society, and private businesses, the event offers a space for leaders in open government to share lessons learned and discuss new ways to advance the global transparency agenda. 

On Thursday, we’ll lead a hands-on workshop on how to [find, analyze, and apply aid data](http://sched.co/4Xfu). By providing an overview of how to find aid information – from [Aid Management Platform country systems](http://malawiaid.finance.gov.mw/portal/) and the [IATI datastore](http://datastore.iatistandard.org/docs/) – as well as some simple ways to analyze this information in Excel, we hope to build confidence among participants in finding and using open data. [As mentioned before](/2015/09/18/designing-human-centered-data-revolution/), key to making open data sustainable and impactful is ensuring it’s actually usable, useful, and used by key audiences – government decisionmakers in particular.

With over 1500 participants expected – and an explicit focus on the role of open government in SDG success – we’re looking forward to valuable conversations and collaborations in Mexico City this week and [beyond](http://opengovhub.org/blog/10/2015/lunchtime-event-putting-lessons-into-action-post-ogp-summit-2015-nov-6th).
