Over the next couple of days, we’re looking forward to discussing open data tools with attendees of the [Africa Open Data Conference](http://www.africaopendata.net/) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. 

Every day, more and more data is added to the open data ecosystem – but this information isn’t always accessible in its “raw” form. That’s why technology, designed with the user in mind, is so important: the right tool can help make data understandable and useful for decisionmaking.

In Dar, we look forward to talking about the [Aid Management Platform](/expertise/information-management/) and [Open Schools Kenya](www.openschoolskenya.org) – tools designed to make information easy to gather, visualize, and use. We will also be debuting part of a new collaborative effort with the Government of Tanzania, World Bank, DG, and DataVision: Tanzania Sectoral Service Performance Dashboards. These dashboards will collect, synthesize, and visualize data from the health, education, and water sectors – supporting decision-making and spurring national dialogue about Tanzania’s future development.

As the world prepares for post-2015 goals, we will continue to empower practitioners, governments, and citizens with the knowledge – and tools – they need to improve lives.
