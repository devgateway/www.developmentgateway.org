One year ago this month, the Sustainable Development Goals were [unanimously adopted](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=51968#.V9gDxVf5Pdl) by the United Nations General Assembly – signaling that the world was “all in” on the 2030 Agenda. Since then, we’ve decided on targets and indicators – for [better or worse](http://deliver2030.org/?p=6907) – and have mobilized multi-stakeholder initiatives like the [Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data](http://www.data4sdgs.org) to turn rhetoric into reality.

[Last year]({% post_url 2015-08-19-from-goals-to-progress %}), we recommended five key enablers of the data revolution for sustainable development; one year later, let’s take stock of how we’re doing so far.

**Data Baselines**

The SDGs continue to faces challenges of [incomplete or out-of-date](http://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-sdgs-can-we-track-now) baseline data; but fortunately, proactive members of our community continue to make resourcing and supporting statistics a priority. The [Advanced Data Planning Tool](http://www.paris21.org/Advanced_Data_Planning_Tool-ADAPT) (ADAPT) from PARIS21 seeks to support national statistical offices (NSOs) in identifying data gaps, and [Open Data Watch](http://opendatawatch.com/strategy-guidance/data-for-development-action-plan/) raises awareness of the resources and needs of national statistical systems, to name a few. There is still a ways to go before we have complete, timely, and global baseline indicator coverage, but, as so well said by incoming GPSDD Executive Director Claire Melamed, [poor or missing data should not stop us](https://www.devex.com/news/should-bad-data-mean-no-action-88551) from pushing the SDGs forward.

**Data Collection and Management**

Over the past year, through the [Results Data Initiative](http://www.developmentgateway.org/expertise/results/), DG has worked to understand how data are collected, shared, and used at the local level - particularly important, as these local level actors will be responsible for measuring SDG success. Our findings? “We” as international organizations want more data points than our local-level colleagues have the [time or resources]({% post_url 2016-03-03-results-indicators-costs-benefits %}) to collect - and those data points are often [duplicative]({% post_url 2016-08-09-tangled-web-we-weave %}) and [non-critical]({% post_url 2016-04-04-who-benefits-development-data %}). Those at the “top” of the international data chain need to honestly prioritize which data are needed and why; those who develop technology (like DG) need to get better at [designing tools]({% post_url 2016-04-11-putting-digital-principles-practice %}) that are useful for local actors. 

**Data Sharing**

Ensuring all these new data points we create are [accessible, multi-lingual, and interpreted context]({% post_url 2015-09-15-data-sharing-access-language-context %}) remains a challenge - but as an international community, we’re making progress. On the hyper-techie side, the [Joined Up Data Alliance](http://juds.joinedupdata.org/consultation-papers/) is pushing us to be proactive in ensuring data standards can “talk” to each other. As our [RDI work](http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/how-we-can-better-collect-share-and-use-results-data) demonstrated, we have the power on the tech and analytics side to make data more useful; the next hurdle will be empowering data leaders to ensure this information is *used* in decision-making. 

**Human-centered design**

While an increasingly [popular concept](https://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/), we haven’t quite perfected its implementation when it comes to the data revolution for sustainable development. Emerging rhetoric around [adaptive learning](https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/adaptive-learning-a-broadening-of-the-concept-of-adaptive-management-and-implications-for-its-implementation), [monitoring evaluation and learning](https://www.odi.org/programmes/rapid/monitoring-evaluation-learning), [adaptive management](https://usaidlearninglab.org/learning-guide/adaptive-management), etc., signals that - at least conceptually - we’re beginning to incorporate complexity into program design. While a positive shift, this is still very focused on the supply-side of development: on donors and implementers. As we seek to localize the data revolution worldwide, I hope we seek more [citizen-driven (“demand” side) programs](http://feedbacklabs.org/shifting-accountability-from-the-funder-to-the-end-user/), focused on locally-expressed needs, and relying on community feedback throughout programmatic implementations.

**Data-driven engagement**

Unlike their predecessors, the Millennium Development Goals, the SDGs have been [more inclusive from the start](http://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/one-year-sdgs-provide-reason-hope). Specifically, every country is expected to work towards a sustainable 2030 - and be inclusive in the process. Excitingly, engagement around the SDGs has been both strong and diverse, from [national-level workshops]({% post_url 2016-08-10-tanzania-and-kenya-sdg-roadmap-workshops %}), to [city-level initiatives](http://unsdsn.org/news/2016/02/19/getting-started-with-sdg-implementation-in-baltimore-usa/), to [public education campaigns](http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/marketing_comms/sustainable_brands/undp_about_school_china_significance_sdgs). Initiatives such as [FeedBack Labs](http://feedbacklabs.org) and [rhetorical nods](http://blogs.worldbank.org/governance/citizen-feedback-inclusive-institutions-10-lessons) from major donors - not to mention the explosion of [tech-enabled human connectivity](http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/) - are making it easier to communicate with individuals around the globe. To keep momentum behind - and truly localize - the SDGs, emphasis on engagement and [communication](http://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/is-it-time-for-the-aid-community-to-explain-itself-to-developing-countries/) should continue. 

So how are we doing on enabling a data revolution for sustainable development? So far, so good - and, excitingly, we can do better. If we build upon what we’ve mobilized and accomplished over the past year - and hasten our progress through a focus on cooperation, innovation, and communication - it can truly be “our” 2030.
