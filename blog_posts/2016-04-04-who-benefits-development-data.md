At what point does more data make us less effective?
 
Over the past several months we have been [teasing out]({{ site.url }}/expertise/results/) how results data quality, sharing, and use can be improved to inform better development outcomes. One of the emerging themes has been a tension around the needs of our “macro” and “micro” selves: what our “macro self” (e.g., staff at development partner headquarters) wants to know in order to [inform big-picture strategy]({{ site.url }}/2016/03/25/donor-mande-systems-processes/), and what our “micro self” (e.g., local-level government and implementers) wants to know to make sure projects [deliver on the local level]({{ site.url }}/2016/03/03/results-indicators-costs-benefits/).
 
This tension isn’t confined to Results Data Initiative work – the [what, how, and who for](http://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/icymi-best-of-this-summers-book-reviews-the-politics-of-evidence/) behind data in development is a fairly entrenched debate with no easy answers. However, some examples from our recent work may provide some insight on the question. For example, just [two weeks ago]({{ site.url }}/2016/01/07/closing-the-evidence-gap/) I spoke with a Honduran development partner who shared that he’s grappling with this same dilemma in his organization:
 
*We have an internal indicator problem. We want to know everything possible about a community in order to analyze and micro-target our projects. But for the community itself, the only questions that matter are: Did I eat today or not? Did my child go to school today or not? Did I experience crime or not? Period.*
 
This point is something we should all be considering: **If we can’t answer the local community’s questions, are we focusing on the right information?** and **Who are we helping when we collect more data to answer different questions?**
 
To be clear: we are *not* saying that there is no value in data reporting. As a community we need to [honestly evaluate](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/19/secret-aid-worker-ngos-abusing-power-costly-evaluations) our impact, and data isn’t automatically “bad” when it cannot be used directly at a local level. Rather, the issue is one of priority and resource investments in data. While there is no foolproof way to strike the right balance between micro- and macro-relevant indicators, this challenge is still worth problematizing – especially as we begin working towards the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics/sustainabledevelopmentgoals) (SDGs). 

Ms. [Jenna Slotin](http://linkis.com/deliver2030.org/1fRAa) of the UN Foundation wrote, quite rightly, that “If designed correctly, the [SDG] indicators should highlight real people’s experiences and whether their lives are getting better or worse.” However, coming in at [230 indicators for 169 targets](http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/un-statistics-body-endorses-sdg-indicators) – and given the real-time gaps in [institutional strength, resources, and methodologies](http://www.cgdev.org/blog/230-indicators-approved-sdg-agenda) – whom does this data-driven approach truly benefit? Are we appeasing our macro-desire for more data at the expense of our micro-level efficacy? At DG, we're trying to put together some [qualitative]({{ site.url }}/2016/03/03/results-indicators-costs-benefits/) and [quantitative]({{ site.url }}/2016/03/23/scraping-by-find-use-donor-results/) evidence that should inform the ways we invest in these kinds of results indicator data as a field moving forward.
 
As we continue to refine our approach towards the SDGs, I hope we prioritize finding the right balance between our macro and micro obligations. Leaving no one behind means both better-planned programs, *and* answering those questions which matter the most to the world’s most vulnerable.
