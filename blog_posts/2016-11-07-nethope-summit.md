This week, DG will be at NetHope’s 2016 Global Summit in Atlanta, where we look forward to discussing how data can be made usable and actionable to drive results.  You can find us at the following sessions -- or tweet at [@DGateway](https://twitter.com/dgateway) if you’d like to find a time to overlap.

**[Making Data Matter: Action, Results and What Comes Next](https://nethopeglobalsummit2016.sched.org/event/53de2231baab7c3297987acda5dd5755)**  
*Tuesday, November 8 • 5:15pm - 6:00pm*


Modern NGOs and crisis responders spend a great deal of time collecting and managing data, but there is little payoff if that data is not [used to understand results or make decisions]({% post_url 2016-03-03-results-indicators-costs-benefits %}). We will discuss the importance of creating strong data cultures within organizations, and will include case studies about crisis data, [Gates Foundation research on interoperability]({% post_url 2016-06-08-unlocking-development-results-data %}), and how to visualize progress toward the SDGs.

**[Birds of a Feather Dinner: The Future of GIS Mapping](https://nethopeglobalsummit2016.sched.org/event/6d68cdbaf768bac8867a5bd9a899b919)**  
*Monday, November 7 • 8:00pm - 10:00pm*


[Maps are cool](http://openschoolskenya.org) -- let's chat about them.  [What are we doing with GIS?](http://maji.takwimu.org/#/dash/points/waterpoints/?_k=3kbglt)  What would we like to be doing with it?  Are there areas where maps are more of a distraction than a useful tool?  How will they be used in the newest areas of industry innovation -- IoT, resilience, [SDG data]({% post_url 2016-09-26-kenya-forestry-app %}), etc?
