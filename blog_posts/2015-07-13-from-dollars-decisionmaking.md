This week, delegates from around the world are meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the third [Financing for Development conference](http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffd3/conference.html). 

One key outcome for this conference will be securing adequate financial commitments from donors in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. This aim received a boost on Friday, [with the announcement](http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2015/pr15329.htm) from the International Monetary Fund and key Multilateral Development Banks that over $400 billion in financing will be extended to support the SDGs over the next three years. 

However, beyond dollars and cents, **a central focus for FFD should be plans for empowering aid-receiving countries with the tools and skills to manage and use development resources effectively.** As the nature of development assistance changes, let’s remember that in addition to resources, our partner-government colleagues need the tools, skills and processes to manage, analyze, and allocate these resources for maximum effect. And providers of development finance — whether traditional donors or otherwise — should continue to make it easy for partner countries to access, understand and use data about development assistance. After a decade of pioneering aid information management tools and processes, we at DG are confident that **empowering decision-makers to use information effectively** is the key to long-term SDG success. 

To our colleagues at FFD, best of luck for a productive meeting, and we look forward to many positive outcomes.
