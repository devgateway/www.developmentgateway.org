Development Gateway and [Global Integrity](http://www.globalintegrity.org/) are thrilled to announce plans for the new [OpenGov Hub](http://www.opengovhub.org/), an endeavor to bring like-minded organizations together in one physical location to work on issues related to the open government agenda. The OpenGov Hub will be housed in Development Gateway’s current headquarters in Washington, DC, and will open officially in September.

The hub aims to be the day-to-day home for small- to medium-sized non-profit organizations that focus on 1) information transparency, 2) civic engagement and participation, and 3) accountability and anti-corruption issues. The initial anchor organizations—the larger tenants—will be Development Gateway and Global Integrity. There will also be desk space for a half dozen smaller organizations and expressions of interest are welcome from any group pursuing broadly related activities. A modest number of “hot desks” will also be available for affiliated individuals who need short term office space while visiting Washington. Currently, Development Gateway and Global Integrity are at work transforming DG’s existing office space into an open environment—tearing down doors and walls—so that individuals from different organizations can brainstorm, share experiences, and work alongside each other toward a more transparent, efficient, accountable, and participatory public sector.

Global Integrity is an innovation lab that produces high-quality research and creates cutting-edge technology to advance the work of a global network of civic, public, and private reformers pursuing increased transparency and accountability in governments. In addition to its core team, Global Integrity collaborates with a global network of more than 1,300 in-country contributors and partners who take technologies, tools, and information to where they are most useful – the local level.

Today, [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com/) [announced](http://opengovhub.org/blog/frontlinesms-to-join-opengov-hub) that it will also move into the hub this fall. FrontlineSMS is one of the true innovators in the mobile space that have built some incredible technology which empowers large-scale communication using text messages. Frontline’s presence in the OpenGov Hub brings additional technical and grassroots experience to the hub community.

The OpenGov Hub will feature regular learning and outreach events aimed at both its regular tenants and the broader open government community of practice in the Washington, DC area.
