As a learning organization, DG has come a long way in our understanding of the needs of development data users. Turning more data into *more useful* data can [be facilitated by technology]({% post_url 2016-09-08-open-data-tanzania %}). But, just as importantly, a culture of data use also requires the right [incentives, resources, and leadership]({% post_url 2016-09-06-rdi-policy-brief %}) -- a challenge that will require more collaboration and innovation as a development community.

We are actively applying these findings across our workstreams. In partnership with the Office of the Deputy President of Kenya, we recently launched a prototype [Kenya Forestry Application]({% post_url 2016-09-26-kenya-forestry-app %}), in support of the country's work around [Sustainable Development Goal 15]({% post_url 2016-09-13-SDGs-year-one %}) – representing a convergence of technology, incentives, and leadership. Through the [Initiative for OpenAg Funding]({% post_url 2016-08-05-data-doesnt-grow-trees %}), we are [seeking to understand]({% post_url 2016-10-07-open-ag-iodc %}) the needs of data users, and burdens faced by data producers, in order to develop meaningful, relevant recommendations around improving data quality and usability – combining technology, incentives, and resources. And our [Cities Data Toolkit]({% post_url 2016-09-22-cities-toolkit %}), recently featured on [BBC Click]({% post_url 2016-08-02-cities-toolkit-featured-bbc %}), aims to support city officials planning or implementing data management processes – bringing together incentives, resources, and leadership. 

Over the coming months, we will continue to pursue better, more holistic ways of [creating]({% post_url 2016-11-02-building-ims %}), [sharing]({% post_url 2016-08-24-scorecard-operationalization %}), and [using]({% post_url 2016-07-19-chad-amp-public %}) data for decision-making -- and communicate our findings widely. In the era of "global goals"  and "leaving no one behind", the ability to learn, adapt, and grow as a community has never been more important.
