The Open Development Technology Alliance (ODTA) aims to enhance accountability and improve the delivery and quality of public services through technology-enabled citizen engagement. The ODTA is an initiative of The World Bank, anchored by the World Bank Institute, the Social Development Department and the ICT Sector Unit of The World Bank.

Development Gateway is proud to announce that ODTA's new portal [ODTA.NET](http://odta.net/), is built on the Zunia.org platform. ODTA.net replaces opendta.org and leverages the Zunia platform to allow users to share events, news, stories, and general posts about the use and impact of technologies to improve public service delivery.

Thanks to the partnership between Development Gateway and ODTA on the odta.net platform, Zunia.org now has an enhanced Group feature that allows individuals and organizations to create their own knowledge sharing platform, to disseminate their expertise, and to organize topical content.

For more information on Zunia.org and its innovations please contact [Riccardo de Marchi Trevisan](mailto:rdemarchi@developmentgateway.org)
