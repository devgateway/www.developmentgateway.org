We are proud to debut our *[Results Data Initiative: Findings from Sri Lanka]({{ site.url }}/assets/post-resources/RDI-SriLanka.pdf)* report. The report delves into the real-world experiences of results data users in the development sector – with a special focus on local governments. We explore how these actors collect data on results (outputs/outcomes), how the data is shared between actors, and to what extent people actually use this data to inform projects, policies and plans. 

Combined with the other outputs of the [Results Data Initiative]({{ site.url }}/expertise/results/) (RDI), we hope these voices from local-level data users will inform future investments in results-based management in Sri Lanka. These lessons also have critical implications for the international data-for-development community, and we hope that development leaders, monitoring & evaluation (M&E) thinkers, and data advocates of all types will take a close look at what we’ve learned and provide feedback to help enrich the discussion.  

We base our findings on interviews with 150+ local government, donor, and NGO officials in the health and agriculture sectors. We describe the results data “landscape,” highlight successes and failures, and outline a way forward for improving the quality and use of results data. Key findings include:

- Data analysis is limited to trend and time analysis at district and provincial levels, as the overall lack of understanding and accountability for results **places perceived responsibility for data analysis at the national level**. Widespread demand for results-oriented data is naturally lacking as a result. But positive deviants do exist – offering powerful examples of how a focus on results and good data can catalyze positive change. 
 
- For most local actors, “results data” is actually just output data at best – largely activity-based, with little or no reporting of outcomes to reflect changes in health, status, income, or employment. Several forward-thinking respondents called for disaggregated outcome data to inform and improve their work. 

- Across the board, respondents reported that spreadsheets are still the primary – if limited – data management tool. Both agriculture and health sectors are ready for more robust, web-based, real-time data management systems. But these systems must be designed to meet the analytical needs of local actors, and not merely report to national-level systems.
