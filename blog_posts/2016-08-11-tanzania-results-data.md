We are pleased to debut our [_Results Data
Initiative: Findings from Tanzania_](http://www.developmentgateway.org/assets/post-resources/RDI-Tanzania.pdf) summary report, the third of
three country reports from our [Results Data Initiative (RDI).](http://www.developmentgateway.org/expertise/results/) The report
explores the ways that local government and other development actors in
Tanzania collect, share and use results data to inform their work in health and
agriculture.

While this report is tailored for government and development
partners in Tanzania, it is also relevant for international M&E
practitioners and the wider data-for-development community. In particular, we
hope that those concerned with monitoring progress toward SDG indicators will
take note of what we’ve learned. Some key findings include:

- **Data Collection “Burdens.”** Health/agriculture service providers are also primary data
collectors, and [face critical trade-offs]({% post_url 2016-03-03-results-indicators-costs-benefits %}) between data and
service delivery obligations. When considering data collection activities,
where possible, government and donors should cut the number of indicators.

- **Data Quality and Use.** There is a gap in understanding and purpose between data “collectors”
(frontline staff) and data ‘users’ (mid-level officials)—and this rift impacts
the quality and usability of results data. More specifically, data collectors
do not know what their data will be used for (besides reporting), and thus view
data interpretation as someone else’s responsibility. Incentives for _using_ results data are absent, as
analysis is not required from most officials, nor is it explicitly recognized
or rewarded. In short: current systems dis-incentivize both good-quality data
and meaningful data use (at every level). But as we outline in our report,
there are practical ways to influence these incentives.

- **Results and Resource Allocation.** The perceived value of a results indicator depends on
the resources available to do something as a result of that data, [similar to our findings in Ghana]({ post_url 2016-06-21-what-do-development-actors-in-ghana-think-about-results-data %}). The reality
observed on the ground was not about how to allocate resources based on
evidence, but how to better spend the limited funds within the given
constraints. There are few incentives for local development actors to consider
evidence or results when making budgets and plans. We also outline
recommendations for addressing this critical challenge.

- **Results and
Decentralization.** Devolution by decentralization is creating new demand for
local results data in Tanzania. As local governments are given more autonomy,
we heard from officials at all levels that disaggregated _outcome_ data is becoming necessary. As donors and governments
prepare plans for collecting data needed to monitor the SDG indicators, the
disaggregated indicator needs of local-level actors should be firmly in mind.

and development partners. Please also reach out via [email](mailto:vbhatia@developmentgateway.org)
