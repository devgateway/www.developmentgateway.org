Development Gateway will participate again this year in the [Esri International User Conference](http://www.esri.com/events/user-conference/index.html?utm_source=AdWords&utm_medium=ideas&utm_campaign=EsriUC2012), to be held from July 23-27, 2012 in [San Diego, CA](http://www.esri.com/events/user-conference/maps/index.html). The theme this year is “GIS – Opening Our World,” in a nod to the idea that geography “provides us with a framework for bringing together our knowledge and experiences about the natural and human worlds.” Each year, the conference provides incredible learning opportunities for organizations, researchers, and analysts whose work involves a mapping or geographical component. You can learn more about the conference from the [frequently asked questions](http://events.esri.com/uc/QandA/index.cfm?fuseaction=printall&ConferenceID=AC1DD535-1422-2418-7F1722E62B9B416A), or check out the full [agenda](http://www.esri.com/events/user-conference/agenda/index.html).

If you are attending, please join us and our partners from the Robert S. Strauss Center’s [Climate Change and African Political Stability (CCAPS)](http://ccaps.strausscenter.org/) program!

**Environment Showcase, Hall B1, Table - #V2741**

Development Gateway and its partners from the Robert S. Strauss Center’s Climate Change and African Political Stability (CCAPS) program of the University of Texas - Austin are exhibiting in the Environment Showcase. Stop by to hear more about our joint work to map aid around the world and combine these data with information on cross-cutting issues like climate change and conflict.

Panel: Geo-Enabling International Development
=============================================

**Tuesday, July 24, 3:15 – 4:30 pm, Room 27 A**

International Development is an enormously complex and global “business” that is affected by economic, financial, social, environmental, and other global issues such as climate change. At its center, geography is the link that allows for the synthesis of all of these data into useful, actionable information. Panelists include Ashley Moran, Director of the CCAPS program, who will discuss practical experiences with integrating different datasets in ArcGIS. Ms. Moran will focus on how to use geodata for analysis, with a particular focus on the work of the CCAPS program in Africa to understand the interaction between climate change, conflict, and aid.

Demo Theater: Mapping Aid Flows
===============================

**Thursday, July 26, 11:00 – 11:30 am**

In this session, **Riccardo de Marchi Trevisan, Partnerships Manager at Development Gateway** and **Ashley Moran, Director of the CCAPS program**, will discuss the benefits of geo-enabling aid information. They will address some of the challenges unique to this field, and ways they can be addressed through technology tools and new methods.
