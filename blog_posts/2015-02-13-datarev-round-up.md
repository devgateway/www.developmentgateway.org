A recent [ODI paper](http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9395.pdf) focused on what ‘localizing’ might be applied in the post-2015 agenda. With the exception of a few broad considerations, it depends on the local context. It’s an important phrase we’re all familiar with, but sometimes is left behind when we start talking about things like scalability. It also means involving local communities in feedback loops from the start.

One thing that is on many local community’s plates is building resilience against the oncoming effects of climate change in their community. Following up to the UNFCCC COP20 in December, is a landscape management framework called [Managing for Resilience](http://peoplefoodandnature.org/blog/building-resilience-among-the-most-vulnerable-populations/) which states it is scalable because the framework relies on local context. If you’re following along with progress on the Data Revolution, then you surely shouldn’t miss the [three issue papers](http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/next-step-data-revolution-financing-emerging-priorities) drafted to make the revolution a reality. The three papers focus on data innovation, public-private partnerships for data, and data literacy and promotion of data use. They’ve welcomed feedback on the papers, so run on over to play your part.

Have a little bit of time on your hands? Not really, but love learning anyway? Lucky for you there are a few options that are quick and accessible from wherever you get Wi-Fi. Check out the [Engineering for Change webinar series](http://www.engineeringforchange-webinars.org/). Then after that, check out USAID’s course on [How to Use Mobile Data Solutions for Better Development Outcomes](http://www.ictworks.org/2015/01/16/free-usaid-course-how-to-use-mobile-data-solutions-for-better-development-outcomes/).
