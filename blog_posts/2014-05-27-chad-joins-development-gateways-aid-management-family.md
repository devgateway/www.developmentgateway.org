Development Gateway is delighted to welcome Chad to the global Aid Management Program family. Chad marks our 24th AMP country, our 16th African partner government, and another of our 20+ UNDP-supported AMP programs. We are looking forward to a productive partnership in the years to come.

Development Gateway conducted an initial needs assessment in Chad in fall 2013, during which we met with various stakeholders including government staff, local technical professionals and several funding agencies including UNDP, the World Bank, AfDB, the EU, France, and the US Embassy. The assessment culminated with specific recommendations regarding how to implement the Aid Management Platform (AMP), with a specific focus on supporting increased participation of Chad’s budget and finance staff with the AMP’s functions so as to improve the overall aid management process.

Chad marks our second AMP country to commit to geocoding project locations and launching a public portal during year one (Cote d’Ivoire was the first). We are thrilled that Chad is devoted to the open data movement and improving the quality of their data with the specific granularity geocoding provides. Chad also hopes to welcome an Aid Management Fellow in the fall of 2014 to assist with an efficient and effective implementation of the system.

The three-year program, including implementation and related institutional strengthening activities, is supported by UNDP in year one. The assessment mission conducted in September 2013 was of high interest to other donors including the World Bank and the African Development Bank.
