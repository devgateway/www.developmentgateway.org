Development Gateway is proud to announce the publication of its 2012-2014 Annual Report!

As the letter from Board Chair Mary O'Kane illustrates:

*The global development conversation has evolved considerably in the last couple of years; calls for greater transparency and active citizen participation grow ever louder. As a social enterprise dedicated to building practical tools that turn information into opportunities for people to lead better lives, Development Gateway (DG) welcomes the new emphasis on open data as a catalyst for building a better world. To answer the UN Secretary General’s call for a post-2015 “data revolution,” DG has transformed itself over the past three years to meet the open data challenge.*

Read more about DG's transformation by [downloading the report](/assets/post-resources/dg_2014_annual_report_eng.pdf), [viewing it online](/about/Annual-Report), or visiting us at the OpenGov Hub for a hardcopy.
