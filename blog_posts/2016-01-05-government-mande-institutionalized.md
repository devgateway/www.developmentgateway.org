The development community is increasingly interested in institutionalizing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in aid recipient governments as one strategy for improving aid effectiveness. Institutional structures within government M&E systems that improve coordination, central oversight, and feedback from different stakeholders can support more effective decision-making.

This second in a series of four posts presenting evidence and trends from the [Evans School Policy Analysis and Research](http://evans.uw.edu/centers-projects/epar/evans-school-policy-analysis-research-group) (EPAR) Group’s [report](http://evans.uw.edu/centers-projects/epar/research/epar-brief-no-299-evaluating-country-me-systems) on aid-recipient government M&E systems focuses on findings on institutionalization and coordination of these systems. EPAR reviewed evidence from 42 government M&E systems, including 17 general national M&E systems that aim to monitor and evaluate progress across multiple sectors and 25 systems that are national in scope but sector-specific. The [first post]({{ site.url }}/2015/12/15/evaluating-government-monitoring-evaluation/) in the series provides an introduction to aid-recipient country M&E systems and outlines the theoretical framework, data, and methods for the research. This post examines how these government M&E systems are organized, summarizing findings on internal demand for M&E, clarity of institutional M&E roles, and harmonization of M&E activities (Figure 1).

**Internal Demand for M&E** 

A review of 20 Sub-Saharan aid-recipient countries ([Holvoet, et. al 2012](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7679.2012.00597.x/abstract)) suggests a strong external demand from donors for M&E information. While external demand can support the development of M&E systems, internal demand from domestic government or [civil society](https://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/Data/reports/monitoring_evaluation_psm.pdf) is claimed by some to lead to more sustainable government M&E systems. [Other authors](http://www.worldbank.org/oed/ecd/docs/proceedings_la_eng.pdf) argue that strong sources of internal demand motivates resources being allocated towards M&E, encourages domestic ownership of M&E activities, and ensures that skills and knowledge remain in the domestic core structure of government. 

Among M&E systems reviewed, systems with “high” internal demand (13 of 42 systems) are characterized by a wide range of stakeholders engaged in strategic planning processes, a focus on reviewing results and performance to inform planning, and high-level political commitment. 

Elected officials, especially Presidents or Prime Ministers, appear to be key drivers of demand for general national M&E systems. In Kenya, for example, the [2010 Constitution includes accountability requirements promoting M&E](http://www.theclearinitiative.org/african_M&E_cases.pdf). Multi-sectoral agencies can also be key drivers of demand. Demand for HIV/AIDS M&E systems, for instance, is often led by multi-sectoral agencies established to monitor progress in achieving HIV/AIDS outcomes (5 of 8 systems). Finally, stakeholders from civil society, such as academic institutions and local non-profit organizations, can contribute significantly to internal demand for M&E information, as noted in 15 of 42 systems.

Half of the systems reviewed (21 of 42) describe challenges for increasing internal demand for M&E. These challenges include limited internal capacity and dedicated resources for responding to increased demand for M&E activities, as well as difficulty managing the pace and sequencing of M&E reforms to overcome internal resistance. Three systems also report difficulties in incentivizing M&E use due to separate systems for monitoring budgets and outcomes or fears that M&E information will jeopardize funding. 

**Clarity of Institutional M&E Roles**

As observed by [Kusek & Rist](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/14926/296720PAPER0100steps.pdf?sequence=1), clear institutional roles and responsibilities not only contribute to a systematic and accountability-driven M&E system, but are necessary for M&E activities to be fully implemented. EPAR finds that defining and clarifying roles and leadership is a key challenge in many M&E systems. [A review of health sector M&E systems in Rwanda and Uganda](http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/4/506.full) concludes that this challenge may emerge from overlapping mandates, loose coordination of M&E activities, and unclear boundaries for M&E functions. 

In spite of these challenges, nearly half of systems reviewed (19 of 42) rate “high” on the clarity of institutional roles, with government plans assigning responsibility for different M&E roles to specific offices and evidence to suggest that these responsibilities are being fulfilled. On the other hand, nine systems have a “low” rating, indicating limited evidence of how M&E activities are assigned and implemented. 

Many systems have one ministry or office responsible for M&E activities, but in some cases the responsibilities are spread across a variety of different offices. Several systems, including the majority of HIV/AIDS M&E systems (8 of 14), confer responsibility to a single multi-sectoral agency drawing representatives from different offices. Of the nine systems with a single multi-sectoral agency responsible for M&E, seven rate “high” for institutional clarity and two rate “medium”, indicating that this approach may help make M&E implementation more effective. For the remaining M&E systems, however, there is no clear association between the types of government offices involved and the clarity of institutional roles.

**Harmonization of M&E Activities**

[Porter and Goldman (2013)](http://www.aejonline.org/index.php/aej/article/viewFile/25/10) write that aid-recipient countries generally have several separate M&E systems, usually including a general national system as well as specific M&E systems for different sectors. This setup can create challenges for efficiency and for coordinating and harmonizing M&E activities. In their 2007 [review of results-based national development strategies](http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/0,,contentMDK:21790579~pagePK:41367~piPK:51533~theSitePK:40941,00.html), the World Bank suggests many systems are challenged by a lack of clarity or mandate for the office in charge of M&E coordination, and others face difficulties in coordinating M&E activities across multiple sectors and levels of government. [Some studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17689314) also find systems have insufficient capacity for coordinating activities, often due to limited funding for staff and relevant skills training. 

EPAR finds that just six M&E systems have clearly coordinated and aligned M&E roles and activities across government offices and levels. Five of these systems are HIV/AIDS systems where multi-sectoral government agencies have clear responsibilities for coordinating M&E activities. The sixth is Mexico’s general national M&E system, where M&E activities are managed by an independent agency, [CONEVAL](http://www.coneval.gob.mx/paginas/principal-en.aspx). 

Among the remaining 37 systems 14 are given “medium” and 11 “low” ratings for M&E harmonization due to undefined roles and responsibilities, weak coordination, and/or overlap or confusion in implementing M&E activities across poorly aligned systems. The final 11 systems do not have enough evidence to assess the harmonization of their M&E activities.

**Improving Institutionalization & Coordination of M&E Systems**

Beyond addressing capacity and resource constraints, the systems reviewed describe a variety of methods for addressing institutionalization and coordination challenges. A common approach to increasing internal demand for M&E in the documents reviewed is increasing communication with, and involvement of, stakeholders by making monitoring information and evaluation findings more accessible. Currently, less than a third of systems (12 of 42) have publicly available raw M&E data. 

Evidence from some M&E systems also indicates that implementing new M&E systems in phases can both reduce resource constraints and allow government offices time to adapt and become sources of internal demand. Also, assigning a clear mandate for M&E coordination to a specific office appears to help clarify and harmonize M&E roles and responsibilities. An example is Nepal’s HIV/AIDS system operating as a multi-sectoral agency with several staff responsible for M&E coordination, regional officers tasked with coordinating M&E functions, clear plans for building regional M&E capacity, and provisions for coordinating monitoring activities with regional health offices.

Several countries have developed well-institutionalized M&E systems in spite of challenges defining and clarifying roles and leadership, aligning and coordinating M&E activities across sectors and levels of government, and building internal capacity for M&E activities. Institutionalizing roles is just one factor in developing an effective M&E system, however. The next two posts in this series examine two other facets of aid-recipient M&E: systems for data collection, analysis and use, and alignment and harmonization of government and development partner M&E systems.
