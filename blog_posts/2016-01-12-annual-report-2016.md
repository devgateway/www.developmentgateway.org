Development Gateway is proud to announce the digital publication of its 2015 Annual Report, showcasing the organization's role as as an initiator and implementer at the heart of the Data Revolution.

As Board Chair Ad Melkert says in his introductory letter:

*Fifteen years ago, inspired by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Development Gateway emerged as an independent organization. As we reflect on what has been achieved and what has been learned, and prepare for the next fifteen SDG years, our mission to empower practitioners, governments, and citizens with the knowledge they need to improve lives is even more relevant today.*
