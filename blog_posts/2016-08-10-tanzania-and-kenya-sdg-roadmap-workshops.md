This week and next, DG will be participating in the Tanzania and Kenya National Data4SDGs Roadmap Workshops, hosted by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD). 

At these events, government, civil society, and private sector representatives will share experiences and good practices around realizing the data revolution at a national level. Importantly, these sessions will foster knowledge and policy networks, and help drive the process toward developing an action plan for making the Sustainable Development Goals a reality.

As participants, we hope to share lessons learned around designing tools and processes aimed at elevating local decision-makers with the right data and incentives for more informed decision-making. And, as long-time partners of government, private sector, and civil society across both Tanzania and Kenya, we look forward to continuing collaborations around better data, technology, and decision-making.
