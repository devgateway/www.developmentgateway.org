As typical when there is a stage and a listening audience, we saw the launch of some new tools and reports in alignment with the Open Data Conference that took place in Ottawa in May. Included is the [OGP Explorer](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/explorer/all-data.html), which is an [interactive tool](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/paul-maassen/2015/05/28/introducing-ogp-explorer) that allows you to compare the countries that have signed on to the OGP, and if they are ahead, late, or not even trying to achieve their commitments.

That week also so the release of the African Development Bank’s [Africa Gender Equality Index](http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Publications/African_Gender_Equality_Index_2015-EN.pdf) which ranks countries on three different dimensions: Women as producers (economic equality), women and human development (access to health and education resources), and women as active citizens and leaders (equality in the law and representation in government). The top five African countries overall are South Africa, Rwanda, Namibia, Mauritius, and Malawi. Read the report to see how the top countries are making strides to strengthen gender equality.

The [GovLab launched](http://thegovlab.org/network-of-innovators-expert-networking-for-open-data/) their [Network of Innovators](http://noi.thegovlab.org/), a way for us to all find each other. “Us” being those of us who work in governance innovation and open data. Almost like a mini LinkedIn, the Network of Innovators should make it easier to find others who are experts in areas where we are seeking expertise for our projects, programs and initiatives.

If you missed out on all the action in Ottawa, catch up by [watching the webcasted sessions](http://opendatacon.org/webcast/), [read about](http://opendatacon.org/building-standards-from-the-ground-up/) what everyone is talking about, and see what everyone is [tweeting about](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IODC15%3Fsrc=hash).
