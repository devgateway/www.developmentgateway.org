Development Gateway is proud to announce AidData's [launch of a new interactive database](http://china.aiddata.org/) that tracks Chinese development finance flows to Africa from 2000 to 2011.

AidData, a partnership between the College of William and Mary, Development Gateway, and BYU, developed an innovative [media-based data collection](http://www.wm.edu/offices/itpir/aiddata/aiddata_research_projects/index.php) (MBDC) methodology, which has helped uncover more than 1,600 Chinese-financed projects amounting to over $75 billion in financial commitments.

The publication of [this data](http://china.aiddata.org/) should provide a stronger empirical foundation for analysis of the nature, distribution, and impact of China's overseas development finance activities in Africa. As a start, the Center for Global Development released the related working paper *Chinaâ€™s Development Finance to Africa: A Media-Based Approach to Data Collection* yesterday afternoon in Washington, DC.

The [Chinese Development Finance in Africa database](http://china.aiddata.org/) makes it possible to filter, manipulate, and visualize the data, and provides tools that enable users to vet and help improve project-level data. Journalists, researchers, policymakers, development practitioners, and the general public can provide additional information about specific projects, such as media reports, documents, videos, and photographs, as well as suggest new projects not previously identified.
