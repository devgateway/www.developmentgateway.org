Development Gateway is pleased to announce that we will be extending the implementation of the Aid Management Program with the government of Haiti, thanks to the support of UNDP Haiti.

We will continue to leverage our experience working on aid management in over 20 different countries around the world to support the government’s commitment to aid effectiveness. Our new activities will include:

- Geocoding the activities of several donors in Haiti (USAID, World Bank, IADB, Canada, EU, etc.), enabling an analysis of where aid is flowing within Haiti alongside needs in each sector
- Training government staff and donors on the Aid Management Platform
- Government staff participation in the 2012 AMP Best Practices Workshop

Since 2009, Development Gateway and the Government of Haiti have collaborated on the Aid Management Program, known locally as the External Assistance Management Module (MGAE), to increase the transparency of foreign aid and strengthen the capacity of government to manage development finance.

Development Gateway looks forward to working with the government of Haiti and UNDP over the coming year to help strengthen their effective use of the resources available for the country's social and economic development.
