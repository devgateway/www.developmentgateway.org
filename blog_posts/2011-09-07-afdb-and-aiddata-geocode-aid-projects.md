The [African Development Bank](http://www.afdb.org "African Development Bank") (AfDB) and AidData recently released a data set containing the sub-national locations of all AfDB projects continent-wide approved from 2009-2010. The data, available at [Open.AidData](http://open.aiddata.org/content/index/geocoding "Geocoding"), represent more than $10 billion in AfDB Group funding to 43 African countries. This release follows the June 2011 launch of an [interactive map](http://184.73.156.57/afdbprojects/ "ARCGis Viewer") of AfDB project activities in Cameroon, Morocco, and Tanzania.

The AfDB projects were geocoded, or tagged with precise sub-national geographic locations, through a partnership with AidData. Using the [UCDP/AidData geocoding methodology](http://open.aiddata.org/content/index/geocoding "UCDP/AidData Geocoding Methodology"), this summer AidData researchers combed through AfDB project documentation to record the regions, districts, or towns where projects were actually being implemented. In many cases, a project has more than one location. In total, AidDataâ€™s researchers, working with AfDB project managers, were able to identify nearly 2,000 sub-national locations for 183 AfDB projects. Using these data, stakeholders can view the precise locations of schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, and other bank-financed activities.

The geocoded data are fully compatible with the IATI geocoding standard and World Bank/AidData Mapping for Results data, also available from [open.aiddata.org](http://open.aiddata.org "Open.AidData") and [maps.worldbank.org](http://maps.worldbank.org "Mapping for Results Initiative"). This allows researchers and analysts to mash up the data to examine donor coordination, sub-national aid targeting, and many other questions. It is exciting to see donors begin mapping their data to provide a clearer picture of the distribution of aid resources within countries, ultimately improving the impact of aid on the ground.
