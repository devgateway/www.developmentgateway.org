In many countries around the world, overseas development assistance (foreign aid) serves as a significant funding source for public programs. However, governments often have an incomplete picture of aid flows in country; some development partners may implement projects outside of government channels, while others provide information in varying formats and schedules. These challenges can prevent governments from developing comprehensive budgets or long-term development plans, and makes it difficult to monitor the performance of donor-funded activities.

Development Gateway’s Aid Management Program provides software tools and institutional strengthening activities to bear in order to improve the availability, accessibility, and usefulness of aid information at the country level.

Since 2005, the program has been implemented in 25 countries around the world, and tracks over US $650 billion in aid finance. Not only has it made government and development partner jobs easier – in many cases, civil society organizations and citizens can access and interact with more transparent and higher-quality aid data through Aid Management Platform (AMP) public portal dashboards, reports, and GIS maps.
