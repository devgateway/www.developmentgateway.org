*[RSVP today for a discussion on what's next for results data.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/whats-next-for-results-data-tickets-26042543950)*

The development community spends over $2 billion each year collecting data on results indicators, ostensibly to improve development efficiency and effectiveness. But are investments really paying off? And what should the future of results measurement look like? 

Over the past year, Development Gateway’s [Results Data Initiative]({{ site.url }}/expertise/results/) has sought to understand the collection and use of results (output and outcome) data at the local level, and to [join up donor data at the macro level](http://rdi.developmentgateway.org) to better understand our collective impact. Focusing on the health and agriculture sectors, we have spoken with nearly 500 local officials, donors, and implementers in Tanzania, Ghana, and Sri Lanka, and evaluated over a decade’s worth of results indicators from 17 donors. 

While many call for higher-quality data, better technology, and greater analytical skills, the development community must also make its results more open, understandable, and actionable. Perhaps most importantly, we have to learn how to [create the right incentives](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/04/tracking-the-goals-four-steps-make-data-matter) for meaningful data use.

**[Join us on Wednesday, July 13, for a half-day discussion to explore these issues in-depth.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/whats-next-for-results-data-tickets-26042543950)** We aim to share lessons learned, spur debate, leave with new thoughts on one overarching question: how can we ensure that investments in results indicators actually help people work more effectively?
