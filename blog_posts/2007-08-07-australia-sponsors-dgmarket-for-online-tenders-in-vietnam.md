The Development Gateway Foundation’s e-procurement information system, dgMarket, was launched at an event held in Hanoi yesterday attended by representatives of the Vietnamese government and the business and donor communities.

This dgMarket implementation was primarily funded by the government of Australia and supported by the government of Luxembourg.

The global dgMarket Web site provides easy access to information on more than $540 billion worth of public sector contracts each year, in 23 languages. These include government contracts in 150 countries funded through international lending agencies such as the World Bank, plus nearly all other public procurement listings from 37 countries thus far.

Vietnam can now begin publishing government tenders online. The site available in the Vietnamese language will bring all the benefits of dgMarket’s global one-stop-shop to Vietnamese companies, including local customer service. Procurement notices selected for publishing for Vietnam will be open to international bidding. This will be the 20th local procurement Web site to use the dgMarket database and platform.

“Vietnam’s joining dgMarket is another step in that country’s efforts to make government contracting more transparent and competitive,” said Mark Fleeton, CEO of the foundation. “It also represents continued progress in the foundation’s goal to expand dgMarket coverage and bring the benefits of more transparent government procurement to people around the world.”

dgMarket Vietnam is a sub-portal of the Vietnam Development Gateway which has already won multiple awards for its pioneering work in ICT for development. It is managed by the Vietnam Sustainable Development Center in collaboration with the Small and Medium Enterprise Promotion Center of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
