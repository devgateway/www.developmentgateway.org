Development Gateway is pleased to announce that we will be implementing the Aid Management Program with the government of Moldova thanks to the generous support of UNDP Moldova.

We will leverage our experience working on aid management in over 20 different countries around the world to support the government’s commitment to share information on external assistance to enhance its effectiveness, transparency and mutual accountability.

The Moldova AMP will assist the government of Moldova in their efforts to:

- Ensure a smooth transition from its current system to AMP;
- Promote transparency through a publicly-accessible web-based portal on international assistance to Moldova;
- Explore a linkage between AMP and the government's public financial management information systems so that aid information can inform national budget planning and execution;
- Facilitate the transfer of information from donors to government by utilizing the IATI standard and related tools.

Through a combination of technical support and institutional strengthening activities, the Aid Management Program helps governments build capacity for managing information on development finance. Development Gateway looks forward to working with the government of Moldova and UNDP over the coming two years to help strengthen their effective use of the resources available for the country's social and economic development.
